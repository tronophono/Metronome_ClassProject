# Metronome_ClassProject
Final project for Microprocessors class using MSP430G2553 microcontroller

This repository will contain all our source code to be used for the MSP430G as well as other documents in which
we use to keep track of workflow.

Notes: This folder contains notes about the metronome, how to use bluetooth.
Design: This folder will contain anything to use for the design part of the project
Source: This folder will contain all the code for the project.


If you guys want to add into the Read me you can do so.

Future improvements
1. Control via app
2. make an encasing
3. Fix communications
4. Add a power off command


Code improvements
1. Will try to document it as much as I can
